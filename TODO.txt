Features
--------
[🟡] Pathfinding fixes
    - Test for performance
    - Ignore recalculations if the target pos is the same as current
    - If the first unit in a group tries to go to an impossible path (eg. an island), then just send all other units
        - in the group to the last pos in the node list of the first unit


Bugfixes
--------

[❌] prevent spectators from cancelling units

[🟡] Fixed some units randomly spawning as neutral
[🟡] Can no longer enter enemy garrisons
    - You can still enter allied garrisons
[🟡] Tall grass and barrier blocks are now ignored by the cursor
[🟡] Fix weird pathing over magma
    - To fix this, there is a new block identical in texture and function to magma called "Walkable Magma"
    - @Mapmakers should replace any regular magma blocks in their maps with this block to improve pathfinding
[❌] Fix #localisation channel problems

---------------

[❌] Only play 1 bell sound when calling multiple villagers to arms

[🟡] Show refund resources popup when cancelling buildings
    - consider switching to SC2 system? (flat 75% refund)

[❌] Shift queueing movements and buildings (not just placement)
    - Add index to sendCommand packets
    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
        - OR just add a list queue to each unit
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints

[❌] Must restart client when switching languages for it to take effect
    - Should do configs first

[❌] /gamerule groundYLevel for mapmakers
    - Maybe separate for ghasts and bridges?

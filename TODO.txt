Wave Survival 0.6
------------------

[❌] Add to main game build, mark as beta

[❌] Fixed a bug where teams would randomly switch

[❌] Fixed a bug where enemy units being stuck would lag out the server

[❌] Disable wave survival and gamemode button on tutorial world

[✔] Time now begins at dusk on the first day

Quality of Life
---------------

[❌] Shift queueing actions

[🟡] Spiders now move towards their target before webbing
    - Test that poison spiders still work correctly

[❌] /gamerule groundYLevel for mapmakers
    - Maybe separate for ghasts and bridges?

[❌] Reduce all ore source values, especially higher tiers

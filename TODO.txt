- Done and testedZ
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs



Wave Survival 0.4
-----------------

Bugfixes
--------
[🟡] Fixed enemies sometimes spawning in the ground
[🟡] Enemy units no longer try to attack bridges or pile up near them
[🟡] Ranged units no longer pile up inside buildings
[❌] Fixed a bug where teams would randomly switch

Quality of Life
---------------
[🟡] Deleting a completed building gives a 50% refund (scaled to how damaged it is)
[🟡] Wave difficulty is advanced on each night regardless of if you cleared the previous wave or not
[🟡] Waves no longer repeat the same faction two nights in a row
[🟡] The spawn warning is now only shown if less than the expected number of units spawned
    - If you see one of these warnings, please show me a screenshot of your world
[🟡] Added another debug option:
    - /debug-next-night - advances to the next night and wave

Piglin wave changes
-------------------
[🟡] Reduced portal count from 1/2 to 1/3 of wave number but with the same total population each wave
[🟡] Portals can no longer spawn over water (but they can still spawn on land across water)
[🟡] Portals can no longer spawn too close to another portal
[🟡] Portals no longer spawn units periodically if there's already too many enemies (2x current wave population)
[🟡] Enemy ghasts no longer friendly fire their own portals

Features
--------
[🟡] Improved pathfinding accuracy for all units
    - Increasing the accuracy also increased server CPU usage, so several optimisations have also been included:
        - If the last move command is identical to the current one (same units, same location, etc.) the command is ignored
        - When moving far distances (>50 blocks), some commands are ignored if the last move command was to a similar location
        - Move commands across water/lava are ignored if the unit would not move as a result (eg. they're stuck at the coast)

[❌] Configurable Unit Costs (Thanks to @DoodleNoodles)
    - Includes all costs, population values and build times
    - Modify the files generated at configs/reignofnether-config.toml to adjust them
    - If the server config is adjusted, this will be enforced for all players joining the match

Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Spectators can no longer cancel units from RTS players' building queues
    - test in lilypad server?
[🟡] Fixed some units randomly spawning as neutral
[✔] Can no longer enter enemy garrisons
    - You can still enter allied garrisons
[✔] Tall grass and barrier blocks are now ignored by the cursor
[🟡] Only save resource data if the unit was actively gathering
[✔] Fix weird pathing over magma
    - To fix this, there is now a new block identical in texture and function to magma called "Walkable Magma"
    - @Mapmakers should replace any regular magma blocks in their maps with this block to improve pathfinding

[❌] Fix #localisation channel problems
[❌] Wipe all saved data on /rts-reset
[❌] You no longer have to restart your client to change button languages

Quality of Life
---------------

[✔] Units now attack survival players automatically when idle or attack-moving (except if allied)
[✔] Reduced volume of the Call To Arms bell when used by villagers
[✔] Cancelling an unfinished building now shows a resource popup for the refund
[✔] You can now right-click the build/repair button to have workers auto-repair nearby buildings

[❌] /gamerule groundYLevel for mapmakers
    - Maybe separate for ghasts and bridges?

Balancing
---------

[✔] Farm growth is no longer random
[🟡] Capitols after the first take twice as long to build
[✔] All Capitols: +50 wood, +100 ore (starting resources adjusted accordingly)

Monsters:
[✔] Wardens: +25 food, +10s, +1 pop
[✔] Spiders & Poison Spiders: +1 dmg
[✔] Pumpkins now take +1s to gather, and give -1 food

1.19.2-1.0.9
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs



Wave Survival
-------------

[❌] Skeletons don't attack but instead flicker their bows up and down

[❌] Piglins don't attack move for some reason?

[❌] Default the gamemode selector to survival

[🟡] You now lose when all buildings are destroyed instead of just your capitol, just like in multiplayer

[✔] Raised quantity of spawns for waves 3+

[✔] Skeletons can now spawn on the first wave

[🟡] Improved spawn location logic again
    - This time, enemies only try to spawn near your outermost buildings to avoid a chance of a wave failing to spawn
    - If none or less than the required enemies spawned, a warning is sent to all players
        - If you see this warning, please tell me and show me a screenshot of your base and map

[✔] Waves now go up to 30, maxing out at 700 total population worth of enemies
    - The spawn logic is likely going to bug out by this point and not actually spawn that many units
    - (I wasn't able to test this properly because I was afraid of melting my PC)

[🟡] Mob frostwalker now works on lava by turning the lava into magma

[🟡] Added Illager waves
    - Illagers spawn in one large group

[🟡] Added Piglin waves
    - Piglins spawn from portals which pop up at the start of the night
    - Half of the wave's population is spawned immediately
    - Portals will trickle enemies in forever until destroyed
    - Currently cannot spawn on water or lava


Features
--------

Villager Militia
    - Town Centres and villagers now have a 'Call to Arms' button
    - When used, they run to the nearest Town Centre to be turned into a Militia unit
    - Militia have 35 HP and 3 damage but cannot do regular worker activities
    - Militia transform back into villagers automatically after 60 seconds
    - Added a bell to the town centre
    [❌] Return to work button to automatically return to last known gathering source/position
        - save last known position on the ability
    [❌] Town bell stops moving halfway

Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] Portals can sometimes stack the same upgrade if they're upgraded with multiple selected

[🟡] Illagers can no longer spawn with random enchantments on their equipment

[🟡] Ranged units now stagger their attack speeds by a few ticks randomly
    - This is to work around Minecraft's built-in 1-tick invincibility frames

[❌] Teams sometimes switch for some reason
    - only happens in wave survival?

[❌] Can't control units when they're on slabs?

[🟡] Animals cannot spawn on Y levels too different to your capitol
    - can't deal with Berlingrad AND also have it work on hill maps ?

[🟡] Queued units no longer progress if you're at the population cap (instead of being stuck at 99%)
    - This is to fix an issue of being able to go over the max cap when the server is lagging


Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] The warpten cheatcode now also makes buildings build themselves without workers

[✔] All buildings can now be built directly adjacent to each other
    - This means you can use houses as walls (but you won't be able to shoot past them)

[🟡] Right click to toggle whether sonic booms are one-click-one-cast or not

[✔] Spectators can see what's being produced on anyone's buildings

[❌] Shift queueing movements and buildings (not just placement)
    - Add index to sendCommand packets
    - Add recursive field to UnitActionItem: nextActionItem
        - OR just add a list queue to each unit
    - Add end detections in goals for when to move to nextActionItem
    - Add clientside checkpoints




Balancing
---------

[❌] Remove creeper friendly fire again, but this time reduce damage dropoff

[✔] All factions may build additional capitols, but only one can produce workers at any given time
    - you can also now delete capitols if you have more than one

[✔] Ghasts: +20s build time, +1 pop



[❌] Add wither upgrade that lets them stack wither on a single enemy
    - Remove +% damage passive to damaged targets
